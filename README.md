# autarquicas - local elections in Portugal 
Repo with data from local elections in Portugal from 2009 to 2013

# Objective

To provide to all raw data from the local elections that can be used to for analysis. The dataset has all information that is publicly available at this time

# Caveats

This datasets **do not** have the information about everyone that was on the lists for each party. This is a structural problem in Portugal, as each county (concelho)'s court deals with the approval, and publishing of the lists. Legislation in Portugal only demands that the lists are made public. Courts and city halls follow the law by **printing the lists** and have the lists glued to windows or at the entrance of the building. **No digital format is available to citizens**
